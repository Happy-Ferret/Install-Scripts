This directory contains the .nsi script the Windows installer is built from as well as a default icon and a non-commercial Creative Commons license.

The license only applies to the binaries shipped with specific copies of software released by me.

Feel free to replace License.rtf with whatever license suits you the most. 

######Note: 
The .nsi file uses "Happy" as a kind of placeholder. You would be wise to replace all instances of "Happy" with a unique name.
